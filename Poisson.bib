  abstract = {This article discusses the use of regression models for count data. A claim is often made in criminology applications that the negative binomial distribution is the conditional distribution of choice when for a count response variable there is evidence of overdispersion. Some go on to assert that the overdisperson problem can be ``solved'' when the negative binomial distribution is used instead of the more conventional Poisson distribution. In this paper, we review the assumptions required for both distributions and show that only under very special circumstances are these claims true.},

  abstract = {Quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression models have equal numbers of parameters, and either could be used for overdispersed count data. While they often give similar results, there can be striking differences in estimating the effects of covariates. We explain when and why such differences occur. The variance of a quasi-Poisson model is a linear function of the mean while the variance of a negative binomial model is a quadratic function of the mean. These variance relationships affect the weights in the iteratively weighted least-squares algorithm of fitting models to data. Because the variance is a function of the mean, large and small counts get weighted differently in quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression. We provide an example using harbor seal counts from aerial surveys. These counts are affected by date, time of day, and time relative to low tide. We present results on a data set that showed a dramatic difference on estimating abundance of harbor seals when using quasi-Poisson vs. negative binomial regression. This difference is described and explained in light of the different weighting used in each regression method. A general understanding of weighting can help ecologists choose between these two methods.},

  volume = {23},
  issn = {0962-2802, 1477-0334},
  abstract = {Zero-inflated (ZI) models, which may be derived as a mixture involving a degenerate distribution at value zero and a distribution such as negative binomial (ZINB), have proved useful in dental and other areas of research by accommodating `extra' zeroes in the data. Used in conjunction with generalized linear models, they allow covariate-adjusted inference of an exposure effect on the mixing probability and on the mean for the non-degenerate distribution. However, these models do not directly provide covariate-adjusted inference for the overall exposure effect. Focusing on the ZINB and zero-inflated beta binomial (ZIBB) models, we propose an approach that uses modelpredicted values for each person under each exposure state. This `average predicted value' (APV) method allows covariate-adjusted estimation of flexible functions of exposure group means such as the difference or ratio. A second approach considers a log link for both components of the ZINB to allow a direct approach to estimation. We apply these new methods to a study of dental caries in very low birth weight adolescents. Simulation studies show good bias and robustness properties for both approaches under various scenarios. Robustness diminishes when there is exposure group imbalance for a covariate with a large effect.},

  abstract = {Summary. A useful discrete distribution (the Conway\textendash{}Maxwell\textendash{}Poisson distribution) is revived and its statistical and probabilistic properties are introduced and explored. This distribution is a two-parameter extension of the Poisson distribution that generalizes some well-known discrete distributions (Poisson, Bernoulli and geometric). It also leads to the generalization of distributions derived from these discrete distributions (i.e. the binomial and negative binomial distributions). We describe three methods for estimating the parameters of the Conway\textendash{}Maxwell\textendash{}Poisson distribution. The first is a fast simple weighted least squares method, which leads to estimates that are sufficiently accurate for practical purposes. The second method, using maximum likelihood, can be used to refine the initial estimates. This method requires iterations and is more computationally intensive. The third estimation method is Bayesian. Using the conjugate prior, the posterior density of the parameters of the Conway\textendash{}Maxwell\textendash{}Poisson distribution is easily computed. It is a flexible distribution that can account for overdispersion or underdispersion that is commonly encountered in count data. We also explore two sets of real world data demonstrating the flexibility and elegance of the Conway\textendash{}Maxwell\textendash{}Poisson distribution in fitting count data which do not seem to follow the Poisson distribution.},

  abstract = {Poisson regression is a popular tool for modeling count data and is applied in a vast array of applications from the social to the physical sciences and beyond. Real data, however, are often over- or under-dispersed and, thus, not conducive to Poisson regression. We propose a regression model based on the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distribution to address this problem. The CMP regression generalizes the well-known Poisson and logistic regression models, and is suitable for fitting count data with a wide range of dispersion levels. With a GLM approach that takes advantage of exponential family properties, we discuss model estimation, inference, diagnostics, and interpretation, and present a test for determining the need for a CMP regression over a standard Poisson regression. We compare the CMP to several alternatives and illustrate its advantages and usefulness using four datasets with varying dispersion.},
